**Overview**

This repository documents the design, fabrication, and testing of a custom four-channel RC low-pass filter developed for the dilution refrigerator in the Quantum Materials and Devices Lab at Duke University. The filter is used to suppress electrical noise and improve temperature measurement accuracy from four thermal sensors located within the cryogenic setup.

Accurate thermal readings are critical for quantum transport experiments, where even small noise levels can affect superconducting and graphene-based device performance. Commercial filtering solutions often introduce unwanted resistance, poor grounding, or thermal drift. This design provides a low-noise, thermally stable, and modular filtering system optimized for cryogenic operation and high-precision signal measurement.

**Performance and Testing**

Noise Reduction: Achieved RMS noise below 5 mV across all channels.

Measurement Stability: Enabled full-range and repeatable thermal sensor readings under cryogenic operation.

Thermal Performance: Stable during 24-hour dilution fridge operation.

Verification: Tested with oscilloscopes, multimeters, and data acquisition modules.

**Author Notes**

The filter combines circuit simulation, PCB design, and experimental testing to improve temperature sensing accuracy in a dilution refrigerator environment.
